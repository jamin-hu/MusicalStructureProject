             I feel so unsure\n
            As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor\n
            As the music dies, something in your eyes\n
            Calls to mind the silver screen\n
            And all its sad good-byes\n\n
            I\'m never gonna dance again\n
            Guilty feet have got no rhythm\n
            Though it\'s easy to pretend\n
            I know you\'re not a fool\n\n
            Should\'ve known better than to cheat a friend\n
            And waste the chance that I\'ve been given\n
            So I\'m never gonna dance again\n
            The way I danced with you\n\n
            Time can never mend\n
            The careless whispers of a good friend\n
            To the heart and mind\n
            Ignorance is kind\n
            There\'s no comfort in the truth\n
            Pain is all you\'ll find\n\n
            I\'m never gonna dance again\n
            Guilty feet have got no rhythm\n
            Though it\'s easy to pretend\n
            I know you\'re not a fool\n\n
            I should\'ve known better than to cheat a friend\n
            And waste the chance that I\'ve been given\n
            So I\'m never gonna dance again\n
            The way I danced with you\n\n
            Never without your love\n\n
            Tonight the music seems so loud\n
            I wish that we could lose this crowd\n
            Maybe it\'s better this way\n
            We\'d hurt each other with the things we\'d want to say\n\n
            We could have been so good together\n
            We could have lived this dance forever\n
            But no one\'s gonna dance with me\n
            Please stay\n\n
            And I\'m never gonna dance again\n
            Guilty feet have got no rhythm\n
            Though it\'s easy to pretend\n
            I know you\'re not a fool\n\n
            Should\'ve known better than to cheat a friend\n
            And waste the chance that I\'ve been given\n
            So I\'m never gonna dance again\n
            The way I danced with you\n\n
            Now that you\'re gone\n
            (Now that you\'re gone) What I did\'s so wrong, so wrong\n
            That you had to leave me alone</item>
        <item>
             I\'ve been alone with you inside my mind\n
            And in my dreams I\'ve kissed your lips a thousand times\n
            I sometimes see you pass outside my door\n
            Hello, is it me you\'re looking for?\n\n
            I can see it in your eyes\n
            I can see it in your smile\n
            You\'re all I\'ve ever wanted, and my arms are open wide\n
            \'Cause you know just what to say\n
            And you know just what to do\n
            And I want to tell you so much, I love you\n\n
            I long to see the sunlight in your hair\n
            And tell you time and time again how much I care\n
            Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow\n
            Hello, I\'ve just got to let you know\n\n
            \'Cause I wonder where you are\n
            And I wonder what you do\n
            Are you somewhere feeling lonely, or is someone loving you?\n
            Tell me how to win your heart\n
            For I haven\'t got a clue\n
            But let me start by saying, I love you\n\n
            Hello, is it me you\'re looking for?\n

             Do you remember the 21st night of September?\n
            Love was changing the minds of pretenders\n
            While chasing the clouds away\n\n
            Our hearts were ringing\n
            In the key that our souls were singing\n
            As we danced in the night\n
            Remember how the stars stole the night away\n\n
            Hey hey hey\n
            Ba de ya, say do you remember\n
            Ba de ya, dancing in September\n

            Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu\n
            Ba duda, badu, ba duda\n\n
            My thoughts are with you\n
            Holding hands with your heart to see you\n
            Only blue talk and love\n
            Remember how we knew love was here to stay\n
            Now December found the love that we shared in September\n
            Only blue talk and love\n
            Remember the true love we share today\n\n
            Hey hey hey\n

             Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk\n
            I\'m a woman\'s man, no time to talk\n
            Music loud and women warm, I\'ve been kicked around\n
            Since I was born\n
            And now it\'s alright, it\'s okay\n
            And you may look the other way\n
            We can try to understand\n
            The New York Times\' effect on man\n\n
            Whether you\'re a brother or whether you\'re a mother\n
            You\'re stayin\' alive, stayin\' alive\n
            Feel the city breakin\' and everybody shakin\'\n

            I\'m a dancin\' man and I just can\'t lose\n
            You know it\'s alright, it\'s okay\n
            I\'ll live to see another day\n
